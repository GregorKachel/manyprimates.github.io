## In progress

The first ManyPrimates symposium will take place from July 10th to July 12th 2020 at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Our plan is to bring people together to discuss the state of the project more broadly but also actively work on analyses for [MP1](/mp1), finalizing the procedures for [MP2](/mp2) and [MP3](/mp3), etc. The symposium will include two keynote talks and plenty of time for workshops and discussions to improve methodologies, and a poster session where you can showcase your own research.

We are currently working on the program. Check back here soon for more information!
