## In progress

<div class="box">
    <p><strong>March 13, 2020</strong>: In light of the coronavirus spread and the restrictions that come with it, we decided to put planning for the symposium on halt. We plan to revisit the situation in 4 weeks and then decide whether it will be possible to hold the symposium in July or not. In the meantime, please don’t make any travel arrangements you can’t easily cancel. If we have to cancel the symposium, we plan to hold it later in the year.</p>

We are planning for the first ManyPrimates symposium to take place from July 8th to July 10th, 2020 at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

Our plan is to bring people together to discuss the state of the project more broadly but also actively work on analyses for [MP1](/mp1), finalizing the procedures for [MP2](/mp2) and [MP3](/mp3), etc. The symposium will include two keynote talks and plenty of time for workshops and discussions to improve methodologies, and a poster session where you can showcase your own research.

We are currently working on the program. Check back here soon for more information!
